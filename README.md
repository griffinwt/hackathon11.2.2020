Pick a Kaggle competition from the following list. You have the choice of completing a regression problem, a classification problem, or an NLP problem involving either classification or sentiment analysis. Perform some EDA, and fit and evaluate at least two models on the dataset you've chosen.

## Timeline

- **9am**: Project introduction.
- **10am**: By 10am, answer the [check-in form](https://forms.gle/kWcfTZjGRj18LHUz6) with the dataset you've chosen.
- **4pm**: 3-minute lightning talks where you walk us through your process. **No slides necessary** -- it's fine if you'd prefer walk us through your Jupyter notebook instead, but remember you only have 3 minutes!
- **5pm**: Make sure your project work has been pushed.

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. We're not expecting anything as polished as project two or three. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least two models fit and scored.

## Rubric

When evaluated against the rubric, we'll take into account that that you had a very limited amount of time to work on this project. Do your best with the time you have.

Scores will be out of 18 points based on the 6 categories in the rubric.

3 points per section.

| Score | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **0** | *Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item.* |
| **1** | *Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **2** | *Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **3** | *Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration.* |

### Data Cleaning and EDA

- Are missing values imputed/handled appropriately?
- Are distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?

### Visualizations

- Are sufficient visualizations provided?
- Do plots accurately demonstrate valid relationships?
- Are plots labeled properly?
- Are plots interpreted appropriately?
- Are plots formatted and scaled appropriately for inclusion in a notebook-based technical report?

### Preprocessing and Modeling

- Are categorical variables appropriately handled?
- Does the student properly split and/or sample the data for validation/training purposes?
- Does the student utilize feature selection to remove noisy or multi-collinear features?
- Does the student test and evaluate a variety of models to identify a production algorithm?
- Does the student defend their choice of production model relevant to the data at hand and the problem?
- Does the student explain how the model works and evaluate its performance successes/downfalls?

### Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding

- Does the student accurately identify and explain the baseline score?
- Does the student select and use metrics relevant to the problem objective?
- Does the student interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference?
- Is domain knowledge demonstrated when interpreting results?

### Project Organization

- Are modules imported correctly (using appropriate aliases)?
- Does the README provide a good executive summary of the project?
- Is markdown formatting used appropriately to structure notebooks?
- Are there an appropriate amount of comments to support the code?
- Are files & directories organized correctly?
- Are there unnecessary files included?
- Do files and directories have well-structured, appropriate, consistent names?

### Python Syntax and Control Flow

- Is care taken to write human readable code?
- Is the code syntactically correct (no runtime errors)?
- Does the code generate desired results (logically correct)?
- Does the code follows general best practices and style guidelines?
- Are Pandas and sklearn functions used appropriately?

Do not duplicate someone else's analysis and make sure to give credit to any resources you used. :)

Have fun!
